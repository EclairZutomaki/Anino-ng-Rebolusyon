Colonial City Pack
Do you need to make city blocks and city environments? This package is perfect to do it! Inspired by colonial architecture, a town was created, with high resolution PBR textures to get that AAA feel for your games. It contains many high quality Props, and each of them has a prefab with their own material. Objects are all optimized and game ready. Now you can build highly detailed colonial town alleys and streets with unique buildings and props in your game.
